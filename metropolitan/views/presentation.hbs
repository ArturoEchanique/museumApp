            <p>The Mona Lisa (/ˌmoʊnə ˈliːsə/; Italian: Gioconda [dʒoˈkonda] or Monna Lisa [ˈmɔnna ˈliːza]; French:
                Joconde [ʒɔkɔ̃d])
                is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal
                masterpiece of the
                Italian Renaissance,[4][5] it has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written
                about, the most
                sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world".[6] The painting's novel qualities include the
                subject's
                enigmatic expression,[7] the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the
                atmospheric
                illusionism.[8]

                The painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini,[9] the wife of Francesco del
                Giocondo. It is painted
                in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and
                later it is
                believed he left it in his will to his favored apprentice Salaì.[10] It had been believed to have been
                painted between
                1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by
                King Francis I of
                France and is now the property of the French Republic. It has been on permanent display at the Louvre in
                Paris since
                1797.[11]

                The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for
                the highest
                known painting insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962[12] (equivalent to $870 million
                in 2021).</p>
